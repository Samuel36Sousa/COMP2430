#### -----------------------------
1. Configuration Instructions
#### -----------------------------

The following instructions have been divided into 6 easy to follow steps

STEP 1 -> Download and install Android Studio ver 4.1.2 // Runtime ver 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01 amd64
          Build # AI-201.8743.12.41.7042882 -- built on December 19, 2020
          The Virtual Machine running should be OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o // powered by open-source software
          Android Studio is distributed by JetBrains LTD and can be found under their web address jetbrains.com 

STEP 2 -> Configure the Virtual Machine to run on your current version of Windows
          This can be done by entering the system BIOS and enabling VM capabilities
          This step will be complete after a system restart

STEP 3 -> Create a new Kotlin project from within the Android Studio launcher and import the kt file into the current runtime
          This will allow the compiler to run the current build of Battle Buddies

STEP 4 -> Create a new instance of a Virtual Device for the code to properly run onto
          ( Preferably a modern build such as Google Pixel 3 or above )
					This may take a moment to complete
	
STEP 5 -> Run the instance of the code within the VM build and wait for the OS to complete runtime configuration
					One the app loads the VM will take over the runtime
					
STEP 6 -> Enjoy the game!
					In order to exit simply click the little "X" button in the VM sub-menu
					Or click the red stop button in the actual compiler

#### -----------------------------
2. Installation Instructions
#### -----------------------------

The following instructions have been divided into 5 easy to follow steps

STEP 1 -> Download all of the app files from this gitHub
					( See Section "4. Manifest" for complete list of all needed files )

STEP 2 -> Follow the first 4 steps from Section "1. Configuration Instructions" in order to set up the compiler and VM

STEP 3 -> Allocate the files into a readible directory for the compiler to locate in order to properly import
					
STEP 4 ->	Add all neccessary files into the comipler / VM 

STEP 5 -> Run the VM in order to complete the runtime setup
					( See steps 5 and 6 in Section "1. Configuration Instructions" for basic VM controls )

SUB-SECTIONS
#### **********
1. MAIN SCREEN
2. FOOD CORNER
3. MINIGAME
#### **********

1. MAIN SCREEN
   The opening screen of the app, the first thing the player sees.  
	 It is a welcoming sight set inside of a home with furniture sprawled about.  
	 There will be an egg which the player is incentivised to tap on in order to hatch their "Buddy".  
	 			- User activity by tapping the screen.  
	 After the egg is hatched, the "Buddy" will be able to partake in the events of feeding and playing.  
	 This screen acts as a main hub for the player to gaze upon their "Buddy" and take a pause every now and again.
	 
2. FOOD CORNER
	 The following screen is the secondary function of the game, one of the two activities currently available to the player.  
	 The player is incentivised to level their "Buddy" by the process of feeding it a multitude of foods.  
	 			- User activity by tapping the screen, dragging food.  
	 After the "Buddy" has been fed, the player can choose to leave the screen or continue to feed the "Buddy".  
	 Feeding increases the happiness of your "Buddy" and is highly encouraged.
	 
3. MINIGAME
   The following screen is the tertiary function of the game, the second of the two activities available to the player.  
	 This acts as an endurance test for the "Buddy" as the objective is to navigate through narrow openings.  
	 			- User activity by correctly timing tapping the screen.  
	 As the player successfully dodges the barriers, the score will increase as well as the speed of which the "Buddy" glides.  
	 Playing this minigame increases the overall gliding speed and agility of the "Buddy" and is also highly encouraged.
